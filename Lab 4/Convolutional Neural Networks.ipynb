It involves algorithms that iteratively learn from data and improve their accuracy over time by optimizing an error metric, typically through the use of loss functions. These functions quantify the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs, guiding the algorithm to minimize this error during training. By continually adjusting and improving, machine learning models can achieve remarkable accuracy in tasks ranging from simple classification to complex decision-making scenarios.\n","\n","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized kind of neural networks particularly effective for analyzing visual imagery. They employ a mathematical operation known as convolution, which uses sliding window techniques to process data. This method is highly efficient in recognizing patterns and features in images due to the sparse interactions and parameter sharing of convolutional layers. These characteristics allow CNNs to capture local patterns like edges and textures with a significantly reduced amount of parameters compared to fully connected networks, making them highly efficient for tasks involving high-dimensional data like images.\n","\n","### Key Components of CNN Architecture\n","\n","The architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) typically includes several key components, each playing a crucial role in the network's ability to process and interpret visual information:\n","\n","- **Convolutional Layers**:\n","  - Apply a number of filters to the input.\n","  - Create feature maps that capture essential details within the data.\n","\n","- **Pooling Layers**:\n","  - Often follow convolutional layers.\n","  - Reduce the spatial size of the feature maps, decreasing the computational load.\n","  - Extract dominant features that are invariant to small changes in the input.\n","\n","- **Fully Connected Layers**:\n","  - Interpret the features extracted by convolutional and pooling layers.\n","  - Perform classification or regression tasks based on the interpreted features.\n","\n","- **Softmax Layer**:\n","  - Typically used in the final layer if the task is classification.\n","  - Outputs the probabilities of the instance belonging to each class.\n","\n","- **Dropout Layers**:\n","  - Included to prevent overfitting.\n","  - Randomly drop units from the neural network during the training process to improve generalization.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BJWcquHGICsO"},"source":["### Example of CNN Architecture: LeNet-5\n","\n","![Example: LeNet-5 Architecture](lenet5.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d3CttKoCICsO"},"source":["### Overview of Neural Network Hyperparameters\n","\n","In training neural networks, various hyperparameters must be predefined to guide the training process.
