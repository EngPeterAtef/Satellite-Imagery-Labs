First introduced in a 2015 paper by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox, its architecture is notably shaped like the letter \"U\", which inspired its name. This structure comprises a contracting path to capture context and a symmetrically expanding path that aids in precise localization, making it particularly adept at leveraging small datasets to achieve highly accurate segmentations. U-Net's ability to accurately segment various tissues and medical conditions has made it a staple in medical imaging and has spurred adaptations for broader image analysis applications. Its success in the medical domain demonstrates its potential for high-impact applications in other fields requiring detailed image segmentation.\n","\n","U-Net's robust architecture has found significant applications in the field of satellite imaging as well. The ability of U-Net to effectively handle multi-scale and high-resolution images makes it particularly suitable for satellite image analysis.

Its structure allows for precise segmentation of complex objects from high-resolution satellite imagery, even with relatively limited labeled datasets.

The format should be `ID1_ID2`, where `ID1` and `ID2` are the student IDs. For example, if the student IDs are `9123456` and `9876543`, then your notebook should be named `9123456_9876543.ipynb`.\n","\n","3. **Check for Completeness:** Ensure that all required tasks are completed and that the notebook runs from start to finish without errors. This step is crucial for a smooth evaluation.\n","\n","4. **Submit Your Work:** Once everything is in order, submit your notebook and any additional files via the designated submission link on Google Classroom **(code: 2yj6e24)**. Make sure you meet the submission deadline to avoid any late penalties.\n","5. Please, note that the same student should submit the assignments for the pair throughout the semester.\n","\n","By following these instructions carefully, you help us in evaluating your work efficiently and fairly **and any failure to adhere to these guidelines can affect your grades**.
